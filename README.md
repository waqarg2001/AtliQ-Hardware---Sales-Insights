Atliq Hardware is a which supplies the hardware peripherals to different clients, such as nomad stores, excel stores, surge stores and its sales are declining.The company has a head office in Dehli and regional offices throughout India.

The market is growing dynamically and the company's sales director is worried about the downward trend of the company in terms of number of sales being made. The sales director need to know how the sales are going in all operations and the information provided by the regional sales managers are not just enough.

Just hearing the numbers or receiving tons of excel files is far from being effective in terms of having a reliable overview of the business. Instead, he wants look at the data and understand whatâ€™s going on right away.
